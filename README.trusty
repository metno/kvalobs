Compiling on Ubuntu 14.4 (trusty)
=================================

There is a bug in the m4 macros for boost on trusty, causing configure
to not find the boost libraries correctly. To fix this, you need to
add the following option to configure:

--with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/


Also, there is an undocumented conflict between the google-mock
package and libgtest-dev. If you want to run tests, make sure that
google-mock is installed, and libgtest-dev is not!
