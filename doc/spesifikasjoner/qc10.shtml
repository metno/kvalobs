    <h1>QC1-0 PREQUALIFICATION</h1>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Gabriel Kielland</b>

<p>
The prequalification of observations are implemented in the steps:
<ol>
<li>Removal of values known to be in error;
<li>Insertion of values when the message is missing.
</ol>

<p>
There are two instances of removal by prequalification. In one instance the false observation is   
expected to be received as a fixed value within the message. In the other instance the value is 
assumed sent from the station as a noise signal. In both instances the removal may be  
remitted with the manual control at a later stage (HQC).
<p>
The noise signal includes instruments which is known to transmit unreliable observations in a manner 
that makes it impossible to apply an automatic correction. The signal received is still stored in 
data.original.
<p>
Working example: The Geonor precipitation bucket readings is known to malfunction during very 
cold periods. Bucket readings are removed when the temperature is below a threshold value.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The table obs_pgm contains the full list of expected observation, the observation program, 
characterised by stationid, parameterid, level, hour of the day and obs_pgm.collector set to false. 
Whenever an expected observation is not recieved the value is inserted in the database as missing and 
flagged accordingly.
