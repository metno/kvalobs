<H1>QC1-1: PREDEFINED CLIMATOLOGICAL TEST VALUES</H1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Knut Johansen</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The KVALOBS range control applies climatological test values, i.e. each station is attributed a set
of values with upper and lower limits for each month.</p>
<p>
Every station has a set of range limit values comprising six values for each month.
The values are:
<ul class=ragged>
<li>Upper physical limit value
<li>Highest test threshold value
<li>High test threshold value
<li>Low test threshold value
<li>Lowest test threshold value
<li>Lower physical limit value
</ul>

<p>
There are two kinds of observation. One is the physical parameters like for
example wind speed measured in m/s. The other is code parameters, for example total cloudiness 
with valid integer values between 0 and 9. The climatological threshold values for the code 
parameters will be identical to upper and lower limit on valid codes.<br>
The physical parameters will have their range limit values set in the following manner:<br>
The upper and lower physical limit value will be identical to the limit values inherited from
the current control system applied to messages from automatic stations.<br>
The highest and lowest test threshold value is initially set to the highest and lowest value 
measured during the latest 10 years period. The high test threshold value is set equal to
the highest test threshold value minus 10 per cent of the difference between the highest and 
lowest test threshold value. The low test threshold value is set equal to the lowest test threshold value 
plus 10 per cent of the difference between the highest and lowest test threshold value.<br>
The exception from these rules is relative humidity and wind direction with fixed limit values, 
0 - 100% and 0 - 360 degrees respectively.</p>
<p>
The range limit values are stored in the Kvalobs CVS archive. Because the physical limits 
are the same for all stations and months, these limit values are stored in a separate file with 
parameterid and associated limit values only. The other limit values are tabulated with seven 
columns as shown below. The detailed file contains column headers and rows as exemplified below:
</p>

<table border="1" width="90%">
  <tr>
    <td width="14%">Stationid</td>
    <td width="14%">parameterid</td>
    <td width="14%">month </td>
    <td width="14%">highest </td>
    <td width="14%">high </td>
    <td width="15%">lowest </td>
    <td width="15%">low </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="14%">18700 </td>
    <td width="14%">173 </td>
    <td width="14%">1 </td>
    <td width="14%">1032.6 </td>
    <td width="14%">1023.4 </td>
    <td width="15%">940.2 </td>
    <td width="15%">949.4 </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
The input to the Kvalobs database is a table with the same structure as the above.
The table contains limit values for all stations (except automatic stations) in 
operation during the last 10 years. In total there is 914 stations. Only the physical  
parameters at each station is included in the table. The table then consists of some 
100 000 rows.</p>

<p>
New stations established reasonably close to an exisiting one will have applied the same 
limit values as the existing station. In other cases interpolation of limit values from 
near by stations will be used. The interpolation will be relatively simple taking into 
account the distance to existing stations and eventually the difference in elevation.
When there is no existing station sufficiently close model data and for marine stations 
Hindcast data will be applied. The latter also applies to stations which are not 
included in the calculation described above because of deficient quality control as for 
example automatic stations.</p>
