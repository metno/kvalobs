 \section kvman_1 Overview 

 The \em kvManagerd module is responsible for the data and control
 flow in the system. It receive signals from the \em kvDataInputd when
 new observations data is ready in the database. It sends a signal to
 \em kvQabased when data is scheduled for QA control. When the QA
 control is completed it receives a signal from \em kvQabased. A
 signal is now sendt to \em kvServiced to notify that new observation
 is ready for use. It also runs a timely check on the data in the
 database searching for completly missing observations. 

The first action that
 is taken on new observations is a check for missing values. The  
 expected observations values that shall be delivered for a given time
 resides in the database.
 this check it lookup the 
 stationid/typeid in the table \em obs_pgm. Entries for missing data
 fields is added to the observation. The value is set to -32768. After
 this check \em kvQabased is signaled that there is new observations
 to run the QA test on. \em kvQabased has signal back to \em
 kvManagerd when the QA checks has completed. \em kvManagerd send now
 a signal to \em kvServiced to notify that new observations is ready
 to use.

 The \em kvManagerd is also responsible to find observations that is
 totally missing. This check is run once every hour at HH:30. When we
 find observations that is totally missing, dummy data is generated
 for this observation. The data value is set to -32768. And a the flag
 XXX is set to.
