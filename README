INSTALATION NOTES:


Requirements:

Before installation, you will need several libraries:

omniORB 4.0
putools from met.no
boost
cppunit
postgresql
sqlite (for agregator and kvSynopd)
Qt (for qt specific client libraries)
(+ maybe some other tings - to be added)


You may specify how to find these libraries by copying the file
conf/myconf.template into conf/myconf, and then modifying the settings
there.

Note:

Easiest way to install puTools:
make DESTDIR=$HOME/local/ OSTYPE=linux-gnu all install



Compiling:

Compile with make, either from top level, or from a subdirectory.

When compiling fails:

If you have a hard time finding out why a compilation fails, it may be
a good idea to check if (and why) compiling src/lib/kvalobs
fails. Errors during compiling of this library will often ruin the
compilation of the rest of kvalobs.



Installing:

Installing is done through the script INSTALL.main

In order for this to work, two environment variables must be set:

KVALOBS - This is the installation destination.
KVDIR	- The kvalobs source tree location
